InformationSpreadingViz
================

InformationSpreadingViz visualizes references between blog posts and shows how a topic spreads from its original source to other blogs or media.

Motivation
---------------

During the last years online media such as blogs and online news portals have gained an significant amount of influence and have become an important factor in public opinion making.
Unlike traditional print media these online media use to refer to each other to a great extend.
To visualize these references is the aim of this project.
Based on BlogIntelligence data [(www.blog-intelligence.de)](http://www.blog-intelligence.de/ "www.blog-intelligence.de") it shows how an information or topic spreads from its original source.
